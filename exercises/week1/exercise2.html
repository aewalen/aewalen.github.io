      Gluten-free ice-cream dessert. Serve garnished with extra raspberries or
      puree some of the raspberries with a teaspoon of honey and drizzle on top.

    <ul>
      <li>6 egg yolks</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon honey</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>8 ounces fresh raspberries</li>
      <li>2 ½ tablespoons chopped pistachio nuts</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine egg yolks with 3 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon honey in the large
        bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a paddle attachment; beat until
        volume doubles and mixture is pale and creamy, about 10 minutes.

        Beat heavy cream in a bowl with an electric mixer until firm peaks form,
        3 to 4 minutes. Gently fold cream into egg yolk mixture.

        Freeze until semifreddo is chilled, about 1 ½ hour. Remove from freezer
        and stir in raspberries and pistachio nuts. Freeze until firm, at least
        4 hours.

        Let semifreddo soften in the refrigerator before serving, about 15
        minutes. Turn out of the pan and cut into slices.
